<P>The 2001 Web content management (WCM) Magic Quadrant includes three vendors 
in the Leaders segment and 33 vendors in three other segments: Challengers, 
Visionaries and Niche Players. The criteria for positioning are described in 
"Building the Web Content Management Magic Quadrant," M-14-0391. These 
assessments are made from a North American perspective, so buyers in other parts 
of the world may find that some vendors would have increased viability in their 
native regions.</P>
<P><B>Leaders: </B>The leaders represent three major segments of the WCM vendor 
population:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Vendors strongly focused on WCM 
  <LI>Vendors with a suite of enterprise software, including e-commerce and 
  portal products 
  <LI>Traditional document management vendors now addressing the Web </LI></UL>
<P>Interwoven is a specialist that focuses on WCM. It offers seven modules 
ranging from content development templates, through workflow tools that organize 
document review, approval and version control, to indexing and categorization 
tools, to content delivery and syndication. Interwoven's strategy is to treat 
WCM as a very broad "specialty." Thus, the seven modules in its product line 
bump up against the edges of e-commerce and portal software, but are all 
designed to operate with a WCM viewpoint in mind. Interwoven's strength is in 
this focused approach, which tends to keep investments within its core 
competency areas. Its challenges are not to miss any large-scale developments 
that might render its narrow focus off-target or irrelevant and not to define 
WCM so broadly (in an effort to prevent that) that its product line becomes 
diffuse and difficult to integrate.</P>
<P>Vignette sees WCM as more than a framework to enable document creation, 
workflow, version control and Web publishing. Its suite encompasses a broad 
range of additional Web site capabilities, including content syndication, 
personalization and portal functions. An early entrant in the WCM market, 
Vignette has partnerships with many enterprise software vendors that augment its 
offerings with services such as software configuration management (SCM), data 
mining and application development. Vignette's strategy is to provide a broad, 
integrated range of Web site and e-commerce technology that works together, 
including WCM, SCM, personalization, portal and application integration tools. 
Its strength is an expansive vision that puts WCM into a large-scale strategic 
framework. Its challenges include the possibility of being surpassed by a 
more-focused vendor that better addresses the operational details of WCM.</P>
<P>Documentum is a long-standing leader in the pre-Web document management 
market that has repositioned itself to go where the documents are going in 
today's Web-centric world. Unlike most dot-com enterprises, it has been in 
business for 11 years. Documentum's overall strategy is to leverage its 
enterprise document management skills, along with its customer base, and 
transfer its strength in that arena to the Web. Its strengths are experience in 
document management (a long-term leader in that area) and a deep knowledge of 
workflow, version control and archive management. Its challenges include its 
dependency on its document management legacy and reliance on a customer base in 
that domain. It must grow a substantial base of customers that come to it for 
WCM functionality alone.</P>
<P><B>Visionaries: </B>The Visionaries segment includes 10 vendors that have 
strong prospects, but for economic or technical reasons have more modest 
execution ability now. Foremost among these is Stellent (formerly Intranet 
Solutions). It is one of the few WCM vendors that has been profitable for more 
than a few quarters and is a candidate for leadership status in the future. 
Below it are many vendors with good ideas or products that need more money, 
experience and customers to move them upward in "Ability to Execute." Services 
and software vendor divine announced an acquisition of Open Market that may give 
it greater financial resources.</P>
<P><B>Challengers: </B>The Challengers segment has only two vendors. Each is a 
large, multiproduct vendor that integrates content management with a broad 
selection of other enterprise software products. BroadVision offers numerous 
site-management, e-commerce and portal products. It uses a variety of strategies 
to provide WCM, including partnerships with other vendors discussed here. 
Microsoft just purchased WCM vendor NCompass Labs for its Resolution product, 
which it now offers as the Microsoft Content Management Server. These WCM 
products, in part, are propelled to a high Ability to Execute rating by the 
financial resources of BroadVision and Microsoft (NCompass Labs) and the 
vendors' market strength in other areas.</P>
<P><B>Niche Players: </B>The Niche Players segment is the largest, with most of 
the vendors falling into this space. Some of these niche players are SCM vendors 
that have leveraged their SCM experience to also offer WCM products; these 
typically have strong financials based on their overall business but limited WCM 
visibility outside of their SCM base. They need to grow their presence outside 
of the IS organizations and gain a reputation in the broader market. The 
remainder are small vendors that may have good technology but are limited by 
their size, product line breadth, geographic niche or financial circumstances. 
Some vendors have specifically chosen a niche strategy (e.g., many European 
vendors are maintaining a regional focus). Many vendors in this segment were 
started and supported by venture capital, which is now growing scarce; some of 
these vendors are candidates for closure or acquisition through 2002, by 
stronger WCM vendors or by others outside the industry such as e-commerce, 
portal or J2EE application server vendors.</P>
<P><B>User Strategies — Play Hardball: </B>The good news for users is that WCM 
is becoming a buyers' market as the current economic downturn slows IT 
investments at many enterprises. Overall, Gartner expects half of the vendors on 
the 2001 Magic Quadrant to disappear by 2004, through closure or acquisition by 
WCM or other enterprise software vendors. Portal, e-commerce and even 
application-server vendors are eager to acquire WCM capabilities to advertise as 
features, and some will go on buying sprees now that many WCM market caps have 
declined up to 90 percent from their peaks.</P>
<P>Software buyers can also take advantage of this market shrinkage. The 
acquisition of NCompass Labs by Microsoft, a vendor that tends to bring prices 
down in any market it enters, along with the overall economic climate in 
mid-2001, are putting pressure on vendors to bring their prices down 
dramatically — this means between one-third and two-thirds below FY2000 prices, 
or $75,000 to $150,000, instead of $250,000 to $400,000 for software licensing 
for a modest system.</P>
<P>For enterprises with greater demands on the Web site, with application 
integration needs and high scalability issues, the cost for a more-complex 
system will be significantly higher. Typically, the implementation costs begin 
to become a larger multiple of software, sometimes ranging up to six or eight 
times software license costs. Enterprises should pay particular attention to the 
implementation costs for these systems as this can dominate the overall cost. 
The trend is toward a reduction of these costs, but "out of the box" products 
may mean reduced flexibility.</P>
<P>In addition to offering WCM products, some of the vendors in the Magic 
Quadrant also offer SCM products (see Figure 1).</P>

<P>Source: Gartner Research</P>
<P><B>Bottom Line: </B>Users should view WCM as a market under strong price 
pressure and ripe for consolidation. Carefully consider the financial prospects 
of the vendors you evaluate, since many will have trouble keeping their brands 
active through 2004. At the same time, buyers should seize the opportunity to 
negotiate hard and try to bring prices below $200,000. Buyers who demand deep 
discounts will be more likely to get them through 2002 than they would have 
before mid-2001.</P>
